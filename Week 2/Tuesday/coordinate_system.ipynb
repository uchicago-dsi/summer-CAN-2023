    "There are lots of great resources that describe coordinate reference systems and\n",
    "projections in greater detail. For the purposes of this workshop, what is\n",
    "important to understand is that data from the same location but saved in\n",

    "## Components of a CRS\n",
    "\n",
    "CRS information has three components:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Datum:** A model of the shape of the earth. It has angular units (i.e.\n",
    "degrees) and defines the starting point (i.e. where is [0,0]?) so the angles\n",
    "reference a meaningful spot on the earth. Common global datums are WGS84 and\n",
    "NAD83. Datums can also be local - fit to a particular area of the globe, but\n",
    "ill-fitting outside the area of intended use. In this workshop, we will use the\n",
    "[WGS84\n",
    "datum](https://www.linz.govt.nz/data/geodetic-system/datums-projections-and-heights/geodetic-datums/world-geodetic-system-1984-wgs84).\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Projection:** A mathematical transformation of the angular measurements on a\n",
    "round earth to a flat surface (i.e. paper or a computer screen). The units\n",
    "associated with a given projection are usually linear (feet, meters, etc.). In\n",
    "this workshop, we will see data in two different projections.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Additional Parameters:** Additional parameters are often necessary to create\n",
    "the full coordinate reference system. One common additional parameter is a\n",
    "definition of the center of the map. The number of required additional\n",
    "parameters depends on what is needed by each specific projection.\n",
    "\n",
    "> ## Orange Peel Analogy\n",
    "> \n",
    "> A common analogy employed to teach projections is the orange peel analogy. If\n",
    "> you imagine that the Earth is an orange, how you peel it and then flatten the\n",
    "> peel is similar to how projections get made.\n",

    "\n",
    "## Which projection should I use?\n",
    "\n",
    "To decide if a projection is right for your data, answer these questions:  \n",
    "\n",
    "  *  What is the area of minimal distortion?  \n",
    "  *  What aspect of the data does it preserve?  \n",

Online tools like [Projection Wizard](http://projectionwizard.org/) can also help you discover projections that might be a good fit for your data.  \n",

    "## Describing Coordinate Reference Systems  \n",
    "\n",
    "There are several common systems in use for storing and transmitting CRS\n",
    "information, as well as translating among different CRSs. These systems\n",
    "generally comply with ISO 19111. Common systems for describing CRSs include\n",
    "EPSG, OGC WKT, and PROJ strings.\n",
    "\n",
    "# EPSG\n",
    "The [EPSG system](https://epsg.org/home.html) is a database of CRS information maintained by the\n",
    "International Association of Oil and Gas Producers. The dataset contains both CRS definitions and\n",
    "information on how to safely convert data from one CRS to another. Using EPSG is easy as every\n",
    "CRS has an integer identifier, e.g. WGS84 is EPSG:4326. The downside is that you can only use the\n",
    "CRSs defined by EPSG and cannot customise them (some datasets do not have EPSG codes). [epsg.io](http://epsg.io/) is an \n",
    "excellent website for finding suitable projections by location or for finding information about a \n",
    "particular EPSG code.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Well-Known Text\n",
    "The Open Geospatial Consortium WKT standard is used by a number of important geospatial apps and \n",
    "software libraries. WKT is a nested list of geodetic parameters. The structure of the information is \n",
    "[defined on their website](http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/wkt-crs). WKT is valuable in\n",
    "that the CRS information is more transparent than in EPSG, but can be more difficult to read and\n",
    "compare than PROJ since it is meant to necessarily represent more complex CRS information. Additionally, \n",
    "the WKT standard is implemented inconsistently across various software platforms, and the spec itself has \n",
    "[some known issues](https://gdal.org/tutorials/wktproblems.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "# PROJ\n",
    "[PROJ](http://proj4.org/) is an open-source library for storing, representing\n",
    "and transforming CRS information. PROJ strings continue to be used, but the format \n",
    "[is deprecated by the PROJ C maintainers](https://proj.org/faq.html#what-is-the-best-format-for-describing-coordinate-reference-systems) \n",
    "due to inaccuracies when converting to the WKT format. The data and \n",
    "python libraries we will be working with in this workshop use different \n",
    "underlying representations of CRSs under the hood for reprojecting. CRS \n",
    "information can still be represented with EPSG, WKT, or PROJ strings without \n",
    "consequence, but **it is best to only use PROJ strings as a format for viewing \n",
    "CRS information, not for reprojecting data**. \n",
    "\n",
    "PROJ represents CRS information as a text string of key-value pairs, which makes\n",
    "it easy to read and interpret.\n",
    "\n",
    "A PROJ4 string includes the following information: \n",
    "\n",
    "* **proj:** the projection of the data\n",
    "* **zone:** the zone of the data (this is specific to the UTM projection)\n",
    "* **datum:** the datum used\n",

    "## Format interoperability  \n",
    "\n",
    "Many existing file formats were invented by GIS software developers, often in a\n",
    "closed-source environment. This led to the large number of formats on offer today, and\n",
    "considerable problems transferring data between software environments.\n",

    "open-source answer to this issue. \n",
    "\n",
    "GDAL is a set of software tools that translate between almost any geospatial format in\n",
    "common use today (and some not so common ones). GDAL also contains tools for editing\n",
    "and manipulating both raster and vector files, including reprojecting data to different\n",
    "CRSs. GDAL can be used as a standalone command-line tool, or built in to other GIS\n",
    "software. Several open-source GIS programs use GDAL for all file import/export\n",
    "operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Metadata  \n",
    "\n",
    "Spatial data is useless without metadata. Essential metadata includes the CRS\n",
    "information, but proper spatial metadata encompasses more than that. History and \n",
    "provenance of a dataset (how it was made), who is in charge of maintaining it, and\n",
    "appropriate (and inappropriate!) use cases should also be documented in metadata. This\n",
    "information should accompany a spatial dataset wherever it goes. In practice this can\n",
    "be difficult, as many spatial data formats don't have a built-in place to hold this\n",
    "kind of information. Metadata often has to be stored in a companion file, and \n",
    "generated and maintained manually. \n",
